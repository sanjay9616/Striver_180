# Approach 3: By Making A Loop In The First List ## NEED TO IMPLEMENT

# In this algorithm, we make the first list circular by connecting the last node to the first node. Then we take the size of the loop and move the first pointer in the second linked list by that number of nodes. Then take another pointer from the beginning of the second list and increment first and second pointer simultaneously to find the intersection point.
