<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/">110. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree</a></h2>

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

**Input**: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

**Output**: 3

**Example 2:**

**Input**: root = [1,null,2]

**Output**: 2

**Constraints**:

    • The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
    • -100 <= Node.val <= 100
