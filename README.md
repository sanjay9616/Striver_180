<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/description/">112. Balanced Binary Tree</a></h2>

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

**Height-Balanced** - A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

**Example 1:**

**Input**: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

**Output**: true

**Example 2:**

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_2.jpg" alt="not found">

**Input**: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]

**Output**: false

**Example 3:**

**Input**: root = []

**Output**: true

**Constraints**:

    • The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
    • -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
