You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.

Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.

Return A and B.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Note that in your output A should precede B.

**Example 1:**

**Input**: [3 1 2 5 3]

**Output**: [3, 4]

A = 3, B = 4

**Constraints**:

    • 1 <= n <= 10^5
    • nums.length == n + 1
    • 1 <= nums[i] <= n
    • All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
