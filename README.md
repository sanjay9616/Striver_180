You are given a BST (Binary search tree) with’ N’ number of nodes and a value ‘X’. Your task is to find the greatest value node of the BST which is smaller than or equal to ‘X’.

Note :‘X’ is not smaller than the smallest node of BST .

For example:

**Output**: In the above example, For the given BST  and X = 7, the greatest value node of the BST  which is smaller than or equal to  7 is 6.

**Constraints**:

    • 1 <= T <= 5
    • 1 <= N <= 5 * 10 ^ 3
    • 1 <= nodeVal[i] <= 10 ^ 9
    • Time Limit: 1 sec.
