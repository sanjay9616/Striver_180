You are given an array ‘ARR’ of size ‘N’ and an integer ‘K’. Your task is to find the total number of distinct elements present in every ‘K’ sized window of the array. A ‘K’ sized window can also be viewed as a series of continuous ‘K’ elements present in the sequence.

**Example 1**:

**Input**: arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3], k = 4

**Output**: [3, 4, 4, 3]

**Constraints**:

    • 1 <= T <= 10
    • 1 <= N <= 10 ^ 5
    • 1 <= K <= N
    • 1 <=ARR[i] <= 10 ^ 9
